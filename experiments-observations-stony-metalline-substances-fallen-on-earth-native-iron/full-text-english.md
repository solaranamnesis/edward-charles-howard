# Experiments and Observations on certain stony and metalline Substances, which at different Times are said to have fallen on the Earth; also on various Kinds of native Iron.

## By Edward Howard, _Esq. FRS_

Read February 25, 1802.

The concordance of a variety of facts seems to render it most indisputable, that certain stony and metalline substances have, at different periods, fallen on the earth. Whence their origin, or whence they came, is yet, in my judgment, involved in complete obscurity.

The accounts of these peculiar substances, in the early annals, even of the Royal Society, have unfortunately been blended with relations which we now consider as fabulous; and the more ancient histories of stones fallen from heaven, from Jupiter, or from the clouds, have evidently confounded such substances with what have been termed _Ceraunia_, _Bætilia_, _Ombria_, _Brontia_, _etc._ names altogether unappropriate to substances fallen on our globe. Indeed some mislead, and others are inexpressive.

The term Ceraunia, by a misnomer, deduced from its supposed origin, seems, as well as Bætilia,* to have been anciently used to denote many species of stones, which were polished and shaped into various forms, though mostly wedge-lke or triangular, sometimes as instruments, sometimes as oracles, and sometimes as deities. The import of the names, Ombria, Brontia, _etc._ seems subject to the same uncertainty.

In very early ages, it was believed, that stones did in reality fall, as it was said, from heaven, or from the gods; these, either from ignorance, or perhaps from superstitious views, were confounded with other stones, which, by their compact aggregation, were better calculated to be shaped into different instruments, and to which it was convenient to attach a species of mysterious veneration. In modern days, because explosion and report have generally accompanied the descent of such substances, the name of thunderbolt, or thunderstone, has ignorantly attached itself to them; and, because a variety of substances accidentally present, near buildings and trees struck with lightning, have, with the same ignorance, been collected as thunderbolts, the thunderbolt and the fallen metalline substance have been ranked in the same class of absurdity. Certainly, since the phenomena of lightning and electricity have been so well identified, the idea of a thunderbolt is ridiculous. But the existence of peculiar substances fallen on the earth, I cannot hesitate to assert; and, on the concordance of remote and authenticated facts, I shall rest the assertion.

Mr. King, the learned author of _Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds, in these Days, and in ancient Times_, has adduced quotations of the greatest antiquity, descriptive of the descent of fallen stones; and, could it be thought necessary to add antique testimonies to those instanced by so profound an antiquarian, the quotations of Mons. Falconet, in his papers upon Bætilia, inserted in the _Histoire des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres_*; the quotations in Zahn's _Specula Physico-mathematica Historiana_*; the _Fisica Sotterranea_ of Giacinto Gemma; the works of Pliny, and others, might be referred to.

*) Fol. 1696. Vol. 1. p. 385. where a long enumeration of stones fallen from the sky is given.

Dr. Chladni, in his _Observations on the Mass of Iron found in Siberia, and on other Masses of the like Kind_, as well as in his _Observations on Fire-balls and bard Bodies fallen from the Atmosphere_, has collected almost every modern instance of phenomena of this nature.

Mr. Southey relates an account, juridically authenticated, of a stone weighing 10 lbs. which was heard to fall in Portugal, Feb. 19, 1796, and was taken, still warm, from the ground.*

The first of these peculiar substances with which chemistry has interfered, was the stone presented by the Abbé Bachelay to the Royal French Academy. It was found on the 13th of September, 1768, yet hot, by persons who saw it fall. It is described as follows:

"La substance de cette pierre est d'un gris cendré pâle ; lorsqu'on en regarde le grain à la loupe, on apperçoit que cette pierre est parsemée d'une infinité de petits points brillans métalliques, d'un jaune pâle ; sa surface extérieure, celle qui, suivant M. l'Abbé Bachelay, n'étoit point engagée dans la terre, étoit couverte d'une petite couche trés-mince d'une matière noire, boursoufflée dans des endroits, et qui paroissoit avoir été fondue. Cette pierre, frappée dans l'intérieur avec l'acier, ne donnoit aucune étincelle ; si on frappoit, au contraire, sur la petite couche extérieure, qui paroissoit avoir été attaquée par le feu, on parvenoit à en tirer quelques-unes."

The specific gravity of this stone was as 3535 to 1000.

The academicians analyzed the stone, and found it to contain,

Sulphur|8 1/2  
Iron|36  
Vitrifiable earth|55 1/2  
100.

Of their mode of analysis, I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. They were induced to conclude, that the stone, presented to the Academy by the Abbé Bachelay, did not owe its origin to thunder; that it did not fall from heaven; that it was not formed by mineral substances, fused by lightning; and that it was nothing but a species of pyrites, without peculiarity, except as to the hepatic smell disengaged from it by marine acid. "Que cette pierre, qui peut-étre étoit couverte d'une petite couche de terre ou de gazon, aura été frappée par la foudre, et qu'elle aura été ainsi mise en évidence : la chaleur aura été assez grande pour fondre la superficie de la partie frappée, mais elle n'aura pas été assez long-tems continuée pour pouvoir pénétrer dans l'intérieur ; c'est ce qui fait que la pierre n'a point été décomposée. La quantité de matières métalliques qu'elle contenoit, en opposant moins de résistance qu'un autre corps au courant de matière électrique, aura peut-être pu contribuer même a déterminer la direction de la foudre."

The Memoir is however concluded, by observing it to be sufficiently singular, that M. Morand le Fils had presented a fragment of a stone, from the environs of Coutances, also said to have fallen from heaven, which only differed from that of the Abbé Bachelay, because it did not exhale the hepatic smell with spirit of salt. Yet the academicians did not think any conclusion could be drawn from this resemblance, unless that the lightning had fallen by preference on pyritical matter.*

Mons. Barthold, Professeur à l'Ecole centrale du Haut-Rhin, gave I believe the next, and last,* analytical account of what he also denominates _Pierre de Tonnerre_. He describes it thus: "La masse de pierre connue sous le nom de Pierre de Tonnerre d'Ensisheim, pesant environ deux quintaux, a la forme extérieure arrondie, presque ovale, raboteuse, d'un aspect terne et terreux."

*) A very interesting detail of a meteor, and of stones fallen in July, 1790, was given by Professeur Baudin, in the _Magazin für das Neueste aus der Physik_, by Professor Voigt.

"Le fond de la pierre est d'une couleur grise bleuâtre, parsemée de cristaux de pyrites, isolés, d'une cristalisation confuse, en quelques endroits écailleuses, ramassés, formant des nœuds et des petites veines, qui le parcourent en tout sens : la couleur des pyrites est dorée ; le poli leur donne un éclat d'acier, et, exposées à l'atmosphère, elles ternissent et brunissent. On distingue de plus, à l'œil nud, de la mine de fer grise, écailleuse, non sulfureuse, attirable à l'aimant, dissoluble dans les acides, peu oxidé, ou s'approchant beaucoup de l'état métallique."

"La cassure est irrégulière, grenue, d'un grain un peu serré : dans l'intérieur on voit de très petites fentes. Elle ne fait pas feu au briquet ; sa contexture est si lâche qu'elle se laisse entamer au couteau. En la pilant, elle se réduit assez facilement en une poudre grise bleuâtre, d'une odeur terreuse. Quelquefois il se trouve des petits cristaux de mine de fer, qui résistent plus aux coups du pilon."

The specific gravity of the piece in Professor Barthold's possession, was 3233, distilled water being taken at 1000.

The analysis of Mons. Barthold, of which I shall also have occasion to speak hereafter, gave in the 100,

Sulphur|2  
Iron|20  
Magnesia|14  
Alumina|17  
Lime|2  
Silica|42  
97.
